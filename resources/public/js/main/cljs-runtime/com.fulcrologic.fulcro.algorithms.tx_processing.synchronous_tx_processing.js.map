com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing.synchronous-tx-processing\n  \"A transaction processing system that does as much synchronously as possible, and removes various elements\n   of complexity that were inherited from Fulcro 2 in the standard tx processing.\n\n   See `with-synchronous-transactions` for how to install it.\n\n   This tx processing system does as much work synchronously as possible, though it does try to preserve the\n   call-order *semantics* of the standard transaction processing: That is to say that if the optimistic action\n   of a transaction submits a new transaction then that new submission will run *after* the current already-in-progress\n   transaction has finished processing:\n\n   ```\n   (defmutation g [_]\n     (action [{:keys [state]}] (swap! state ...))\n     (ok-action [{:keys [app]}] (transact! app [(h)]))\n     (remote [_] true))\n\n   (defmutation f [_]\n     (action [{:keys [state app]}]\n       (swap! state ...)\n       (transact! app [(g)])))\n\n   ...\n   (dom/a {:onClick (fn []\n                      (transact! this [(f {:x 1})])\n                      (transact! this [(f {:x 2})])\n                      (transact! this [(f {:x 3})])))\n   ```\n\n   A user clicking the above link with std processing could see any of the following:\n\n   ```\n   f,f,f,g,g,g,h,h,h\n   f,f,f,g,h,g,g,h,h\n   f,f,f,g,g,h,g,h,h\n   etc.\n   ```\n\n   In sync tx processing, you would more likely see:\n\n   ```\n   f,g,f,g,f,g,h,h,h\n   ```\n\n   because there is *no guarantee* in Fulcro's semantics about the space between two calls to `transact!`. If your\n   application relies on the groupings that happen with the standard tx processing (submissions while holding a thread\n   go into the queue first) then your application may break when you switch to sync processing.\n\n   Note that transactions *are* treated as atomically as possible. So, if you want a specific grouping you should submit\n   it as a single tx:\n\n   ```\n   (transact! [(f) (g)])\n   (transact! [(f) (g)])\n   ```\n\n   is guaranteed to do `f,g,f,g`, and never `f,f,g,g`, though it is still possible to see `f,g,h,f,g,h`.\n\n   This sync transaction processing system allows you to push most (if not all) behavior of even nested transactions into a single\n   synchronous operation. This will lead to significant improvements in the snappiness of the UI for optimistic operation\n   and should also reduce over-rendering (multiple calls to render due to multiple async operations).\n\n   If your remote is mocked as a synchronous operation, then you can also leverage this tx processor to enable\n   completely synchronous testing of your headless Fulcro application.\n\n   WARNING: This tx processing system does *not* support:\n\n   * `ptransact!`: Pessimistic transactions are a legacy feature of Fulcro 2 that is no longer necessary. New\n   applications should not use the feature, and this sync tx processing system does not support it. The call\n   will succeed, but will behave as a normal `transact!`.\n   \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing.synchronous-tx-processing :refer [in-transaction]]))\n  (:require\n    [clojure.set :as set]\n    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing :as txn]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.lookup :as ah]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations :as m]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.specs]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.inspect.inspect-client :refer [ido ilet]]\n    com.fulcrologic.fulcro.specs\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]))\n\n(defonce apps-in-tx (atom {}))\n\n(declare run-queue! available-work?)\n\n#?(:clj\n   (defmacro in-transaction [app-sym & body]\n     `(let [id# (:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/id ~app-sym)]\n        (swap! apps-in-tx update id# (fnil inc 0))\n        (try\n          ~@body\n          (finally\n            (swap! apps-in-tx update id# dec))))))\n\n(defn top-level?\n  \"Returns true if the current thread is running non-nested transaction processing code.\"\n  [{:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/keys [id]}]\n  (= (-> apps-in-tx deref (get id 0)) 0))\n\n(defn swap-submission-queue!

If the underlying configured rendering algorithm supports it: The\n    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI, and they may be refreshed immediately on\n    `transact!`. This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what\n    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization.
