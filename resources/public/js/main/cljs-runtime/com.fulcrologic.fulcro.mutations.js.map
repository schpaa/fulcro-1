com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations\n  \"Mutations are the central mechanism of getting things done in Fulcro. The term mutation refers to two things:\n\n  * The literal data that stands for the operation. These are lists with a single symbol and a map of parameters. In\n  earlier version, you had to quote them: `'[(f {:x 1})]`, but Fulcro 3 includes a way to declare them so that they\n  auto-quote themselves for convenience. This can be confusing to new users. Remember that a mutation call is nothing\n  more than a *submission* of this data via `comp/transact!` (i.e. call `f` with the parameter `{:x 1}`).\n  * One or more definitions of what to do when the mutation is requested.\n\n  The former are submitted with `transact!` and can be written like so:\n\n  ```\n  ;; The unquote on the parameters is typically needed because you'll use surrounding binding values in them.\n  (let [x 3\n        some-local-value 42]\n    (comp/transact! this `[(f ~{:x x}) (g ~{:y some-local-value})]))\n  ;; or, if pre-declared and required:\n  (let [x 3\n        some-local-value 42]\n    (comp/transact! this [(f {:x x}) (g {:y some-local-value})]))\n  ```\n\n  This works because a mutation *definition* actually builds a record that response to function calls. This means\n\n  ```\n  (defn func [x] (inc x))\n  (defmutation f [params] ...)\n\n  ;; A regular function runs when called...\n  (func 3)\n  ;; => 4\n\n  ;; A mutation simply returns its expression when called:\n  (f {:x 1})\n  ;; => (f {:x 1})\n  ```\n\n  This allows you to embed a mutation expression without quoting in your calls to transact (if desired) or with\n  quoting if you have something like a circular reference problem.\n\n  See the Developer's Guide for more information.\n  \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations))\n  (:require\n    #?(:clj [cljs.analyzer :as ana])\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.dom.events :as evt]\n    [com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core :refer [>def >defn =>]]\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]\n    [taoensso.encore :as enc]\n    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.do-not-use :as futil]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.data-targeting :as targeting]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.merge :as merge]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.lookup :as ah]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tempid :as tempid]\n    [clojure.string :as str])\n  #?(:clj\n     (:import (clojure.lang IFn))))\n\n(>def ::env (s/keys :req-un [:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/app]))\n(>def ::returning comp/component-class?)\n\n#?(:clj\n   (deftype Mutation [sym]\n     IFn\n     (invoke [this]\n       (this {}))\n     (invoke [this args]\n       (list sym args)))\n   :cljs\n   (deftype Mutation [sym]\n     IFn\n     (-invoke [this]\n       (this {}))\n     (-invoke [this args]\n       (list sym args))))\n\n(>defn update-errors-on-ui-component!\n  \"A handler for mutation network results that will place an error, if detected in env, on the data at `ref`.\n  Errors are placed at `k` (defaults to `::m/mutation-error`).\n\n  Typically used as part of the construction of a global default result handler for mutations.\n\n  Swaps against app state and returns `env`.\"\n  ([env]\n   [::env => ::env]\n   (update-errors-on-ui-component! env ::mutation-error))\n  ([env k]\n   [::env keyword? => ::env]\n   (let [{:keys [app state result ref]} env\n         remote-error?
